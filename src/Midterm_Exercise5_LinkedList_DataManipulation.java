 * Course: Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis
 * Period: Midterm
 * Exercise # 5 : Data Manipulation with Linked List
 * 
 * Expected Output:
 * 
Create a Java program with the following requirements/output:

Enter name to be added in our Linked List: Anna
Add new record to our linked list [1-Yes|0-No] ? 1
Enter name to be added in our Linked List: Karen
Add new record to our linked list [1-Yes|0-No] ? 1
Enter name to be added in our Linked List: Nina
Add new record to our linked list [1-Yes|0-No] ? 1
Enter name to be added in our Linked List: Paulo
Add new record to our linked list [1-Yes|0-No] ? 1
Enter name to be added in our Linked List: Renz
Add new record to our linked list [1-Yes|0-No] ? 0

Let's show the records stored in our linked list [Anna, Karen, Nina, Paulo, Renz]

Type in the name that you want to search: Karen
> Is [0]: Anna == Karen? FALSE
> Is [1]: Karen == Karen? TRUE, stored at [1]

What do you want to do [1-Update|2-Delete] ? 2

Updated records stored in our linked list [Anna, Nina, Paulo, Renz]

Type in the name that you want to search: Anna
> Is [0]: Anna == Anna? TRUE, stored at [0]

What do you want to do [1-Update|2-Delete] ? 1
New name to be stored: Kuracha

Updated records stored in our linked list [Kuracha, Nina, Paulo, Renz]

Condition: The program will only stop asking for the value to be searched and perform update/delete in the linked list if there is no more existing nodes (if all of the nodes are deleted).
