## java-labcodes-exercises-dsaa / Java Lab Codes Exercises under Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis

This repository contains the Java Lab Code Exercises that I've created and used when lecturing Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis during my career as Assistant Professor for BSCS, BSIT and BSCOE way back late 2012 to 2015.

If you want to ask some questions about it, feel free to start a discussion or an issue, I'll try my best to answer.

*NOTE: I've created this repo as a reminder to myself that Java has been one of the programming languages that I have in my **IT Personal Skillset Roadmap**. It's also a good way to refresh my Java, GitHub and Markdown skills.*

### Updates/Progress

- **07/05/2024**
    - 10:42 PM [GMT+7/Hanoi] : Tried pulling the repo to my local unit using VS Code, need to retweak `App.java`, especially if some users wanted to try it out and won't get confused with the menu, reuploaded all required folders and source codes.
    - 3:15 PM [GMT+7/Hanoi] : Created `java-labcodes-exercises-dsaa` GitHub `public` repository, added MIT License, and uploaded the original Java codes that I've used way back 2012.

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources, the one uploaded in this repository
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files `*.class` will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

*If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings.*

******

The triangular number of 6 is 21.

Condition: The generation of the asterisk and computing the triangular number must be coded and perfomed in methods, meaning you must have one void main and two methods in your program (one java method for generating the asterisk of the triangular number and one method for computing the triangular number).
```

**Group Exercises Description and Filenames**
1. Prelim_Array_FacRate.java
```
Create a Java program with the following requirements:

1. Your program should have the 3 following single/one dimensional array:

String[] facultyname = new String[5];
String[] facultytype = new String[5];
double[] facultyrate = new double[5];

2. The user will be prompted to enter five (5) faculty records.

Example:

Faculty Name: Abby Nucup
Faculty Type (FT=Full Time/PT=Part Time): FT
Faculty Rate: 150.00

Make sure that the following information must be stored to their respective arrays.

Faculty Name must be stored in facultyname 
Faculty Type must be stored in facultytype
Faculty Rate must be stored in facultyrate

3. After inputting and storing the five records, the program will ask for the array index number of the record he/she want to use. Note that the only allowed numbers to be inputted must range from 0 to 4. Numbers 5 and above are no longer allowed. If the is valid, you must get/retrieve the name and type information stored in the respective array element using the index as tracker.

Example:

Enter record number: 5
Invalid number!
Enter record number: 3

Faculty Name: Nicanor Gustavo
Faculty Type: FT

4. After retrieving the information, the user must input either the number of hours or day. If the faculty is a FT (Full Time), then it should ask for the "Number of Days". If the faculty is a PT (Part Time), then it should ask for the "Number of Hours".

Ex. if FT:

Enter Number of Days: 5

Ex. if PT:

Enter Number of Hours: 8

5. For computing the salary, you must use the following formulas:

FT Formula:

salary = (facultyrate x 8 hours) x Number of Days

double salary = (facultyrate[index] * 8) * numberinputted

PT:

salary = facultyrate x Number of Hours

double salary = facultyrate[index] * numberinputted

6. After inputting the salary, the final output should be:

=For FT=

Salary Report
Faculty Name: Nicanor Gustavo
Faculty Type: FT
Rate: 150.00
Number of Days: 10
Salary: 12,000.00

=For PT=

Salary Report
Faculty Name: Nicanor Gustavo
Faculty Type: PT
Rate: 150.00
Number of Hours: 10
Salary: 1,500.00
```
2. Prelim_LinearBinarySearch.java
```
Create a Java program with the following requirements:

1. Name of the File/Class: LinearBinarySearch.java

2. You must ask the user for the size of the array. Note that you must use one/single dimensional array and the size of your array is dynamic.

Enter the size of the array: 5

3. Ask the user to enter a whole X times. X is based on the size of your array defined by your user. You must also show the array index while asking for a value.

Enter value for [0] : 
1
Enter value for [1] : 3
Enter value for [2] : 6
Enter value for [3] : 2
Enter value for [4] : 8

4. Ask the user for the target value for searching. Note that the user can input any number, even it does not belong to the elements stored in the array.

Enter the target values to be searched: 6

5. Let the user choose if he/she want to use linear or binary searching. Note that just in case that the user typed in an invalid input, the program must be notify and asked for an input again.

[1] Linear Search | [2] Binary Search
Choose the searching algorithm to be used [1 or 2]: 4
Invalid input! Choose the searching algorithm to be used [1 or 2]: 2

6. When the user typed in a valid input. You must show the simulation for each searching algorithm. Your out must look like the following sample outputs below:

*for Linear Searching*

You choose Linear Searching

- Is array[0] : 
1 == 6? FALSE
- Is array[1] : 3 == 6? FALSE
- Is array[2] : 6 == 6? TRUE, stored at [2]

*for Binary Searching*

You choose Binary Searching

Let us sort the array first
[0][1][2][3][4]

### Exercises under Final Period
**Individual Exercises Description and Filenames**
1. Finals_Shellsort.java
```
Create a Java program with the following requirements: 

REQUIREMENTS:
- create a one dimensional array, the size will be based on the answer in the "Enter the number of values to be inserted". Example: if the user inputted 8, that means you must create a one dimensional array with the size of 8.
- prompt the user to input number (the number of input based on the answer in the "Enter the number of values to be inserted"). save the numbers inputted in your one dimensional arrray.
- ask the user for the required N-sort. please note of the two rules in N-sorting under shellsort: (1) zero (0) is not valid N and (2) it can only be ranging from one (1) up to the half of the inputted number of elements. so if the number of elements is 8, that means the valid N is ranging from 1 to 4 only.
- after the user inputted the valid value for N, display the numbers inputted earlier and stored in your one dimensional array.
- implement the shellsorting afterwards.

OUTPUT:

Enter the number of values to be inserted: 8

Type a number: 8
Type a number: 7
Type a number: 6
Type a number: 5
Type a number: 4
Type a number: 3
Type a number: 2
Type a number: 1

Enter the required N-sort: 7
The N is either less than or more than the required N sort value.

Enter the required N-sort: 0
The N is either less than or more than the required N sort value.

Enter the required N-sort: 4

Current content of the 4-sorted:

8  7  6  5  
4  3  2  1  

Sorted content of the 4-sorted:

4  3  2  1  
8  7  6  5
